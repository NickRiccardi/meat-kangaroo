# Two Word Test
## Combinatorial Semantics Benchmark for Large Language Models (LLMs)
### Nicholas Riccardi and Rutvik Desai - University of South Carolina Department of Psychology

LLMs sometimes struggle with word-order effects and compositional (or combinatorial) language processes, especially when surrounding context is absent. Here, we provide the Two Word Test, a series of functions that compares LLM meaningfulness judgments of 2,160 simple two word phrases to meaningfulness judgments made by humans (Graves, W.W., Binder, J.R. & Seidenberg, M.S. Noun–noun combination: Meaningfulness ratings and lexical statistics for 2,160 word pairs. Behav Res 45, 463–469 (2013). https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-012-0256-3).

We provide a variety of statistical methods to quantify LLM performance and compare it to human performance. We test OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo, and Google's Bard. Briefly, we find that GPT-3.5 and Bard fail dramatically at judging the meaningfulness of simple two word phrases without context. GPT-4 performs substantially better, but still fails in certain circumstances, especially when asked to make continuous instead of binary judgments. See attached manuscript for full details.

## Using the Two Word Test

To gather LLM meaningfulness ratings, we used the prompts detailed in our manuscript (closely mirroring the prompt used by Graves et al., 2013 to gather human ratings, but providing more examples for the LLMs). We collected binary and continuous ratings for all models. two-word-test.ipynb can be run as-is, taking LLM_ratings.csv and graves_2013.csv as input. LLM_ratings.csv can be updated by adding the ratings from other LLMs, which must then be specified in the models list within two-word-test.ipynb. A description of each function's purpose and brief explanations of the statistical tests can be found within.

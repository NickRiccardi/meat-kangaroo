Read each phrase, then judge how meaningful it is as a single concept, using a scale from 0 to 4 as follows: If the phrase makes no sense, the appropriate rating is 0. If the phrase makes some sense, the appropriate rating is 2. If the phrase makes complete sense, the appropriate rating is a 4. Please consider the full range of the scale when making your ratings. Examples: 'the goat sky' is 0 (makes no sense), 'the knife army' is 1 (makes very little sense), 'the fox mask' is 2 (makes some sense), 'the soap bubble' is 3 (makes a lot of sense), and 'the computer programmer' is 4 (makes complete sense). Give an answer for each phrase and respond in the format of 'phrase: response'
